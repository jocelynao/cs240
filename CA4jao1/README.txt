My program is fairly straightforward. It includes a user interface and it lists the words that you can type in to call the function. It'll ask for the necessary input when you type in the command. PRINT will print out the strings that you have added, the vector of alphabetical indices, the vector of length indices, the alphabet index associated with each of the strings, and the length index associated with each of the strings.

If the string vector has {tree, cat, dog},
the section labeled "alphabet indices" should be
{2, 0, 1}
Tree's alphabet index is 2, cat's alphabet index is 0, and dog's alphabet index is 1.
